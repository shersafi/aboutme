            <h3 class="hobbies-details">
                Born and raised in Toronto. My passions and hobbies have always been Mathematics, Technology and Art. 
                Because of this, I was able to find additional hobbies that I love such as front-end development and digital art, which combine all three of my favourite hobbies. 
                However, it does not stop there! Recently I have been learning about new disciplines in Computer Science that focus more on Mathematics. These include Cryptography 
                and Machine Learning. I have to say, I really appreciate these branches of Computer Science because it works a lot more with numbers than things like application building, 
                which almost always use Mathematics to a minimum.
